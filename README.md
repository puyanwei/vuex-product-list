# vuex-product-list

This is a project to help me learn how to use Vue.js's state manager library Vuex with the help of this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGAu__J4xoc&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9i371QO_Rtkl26MwtiJ30P2) from Net Ninja.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
